```Morphological analyzers and other digital tools for Uralic languages```

# Searching for a methodology for linguistics
* (1) Extract paradigms from grammars, readers and research to build an analyzer.
* (2) Extract words, part-of-speech information and definitions from existing dictionaries and research. Build on what has already been done (Dutch, French, German, Russian,…)
* (3) Test analysis coverage on written texts. Are the forms unrecognized proper words?
* (4) Disambiguate morphological analyses based on grammars and research. Point out gaps in descriptions
* (5) Test syntactic disambiguation on example sentences cited in grammatical descriptions of the language. And then retest on text corpora.
* (6) Make disambiguated sentences public, so others can test. One by-product of these golden standards are treebanks.
(7) Use all phases to benefit the speaker and research community

# Minority Uralic language forms with finite-state morphology development
* Balto-Finnic: fit = Meänkieli, fkv = Kveen, izh = Ingrian, krl = Karelian, liv = Livonian, olo = Olonets-Karelian aka Livvi, vep = Veps, vot = Votic, vro = Võro
* Sami: sjd  = Kildin Sami, sje  = Pite Sami, sma = South Sami, sme = Northern Sami, smj = Lule Sami, smn = Inari Sami, sms = Skolt Sami
* Mordvin: mdf = Moksha, myv = Erzya 
* Mari: mhr = Meadow & Eastern Mari, mrj  = Hill Mari aka Western Mari
* Permic: koi = Komi-Permyak, kpv = Komi-Zyrian, udm = Udmurt
* Ob Ugrian: kca = Khanty, mns = Mansi 
* Samoyedic: nio = Nganasan , sel = Selkup, yrk = Nenets

# Pertinent majority languages with finite-state morphology development
* Uralic languages in majority: est = Estonian, fin = Finnish, hun = Hungarian
* Auxilliary languages: deu = German, lav = Latvian, nob = Norwegian Bokmål, rus = Russian, tat = Tatar
